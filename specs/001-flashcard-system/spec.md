# Feature Specification: Flashcard Learning System

**Feature Branch**: `001-flashcard-system`  
**Created**: 2025-10-22  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build an application that can help me organize learn a language. The first feature would be to be the ability to add flashcards and then use them. The implementation should use python and javascript and should be as simple as possible."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Create Flashcards (Priority: P1)

A language learner wants to create digital flashcards for vocabulary words they're studying. They need to input the word in their target language on one side and the translation or definition on the other side.

**Why this priority**: Creating flashcards is the foundational functionality - without it, there's nothing to study. This delivers immediate value by allowing users to digitize their vocabulary learning.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a flashcard with front/back content and verifying it's saved and retrievable, delivering a functional flashcard creation system.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user is on the flashcard creation page, **When** they enter a word on the front side and translation on the back side and click save, **Then** the flashcard is created and appears in their flashcard collection
2. **Given** the user tries to create a flashcard, **When** they leave either the front or back side empty, **Then** they receive a validation error message
3. **Given** the user has created a flashcard, **When** they view their flashcard collection, **Then** they can see the flashcard they just created

### User Story 2 - Study Flashcards (Priority: P2)

A language learner wants to review their created flashcards in a study session. They should be able to see one side of the card, try to recall the answer, then reveal the other side to check their knowledge.

**Why this priority**: This completes the core flashcard learning loop and provides the actual learning value from the created flashcards.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by starting a study session with existing flashcards, going through the reveal/check process, and completing the session.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user has flashcards in their collection, **When** they start a study session, **Then** they see the front side of a flashcard
2. **Given** the user is viewing the front side of a flashcard, **When** they click "Show Answer", **Then** the back side is revealed
3. **Given** the user has revealed the answer, **When** they mark whether they got it right or wrong, **Then** the system records their response and shows the next flashcard

### User Story 3 - Manage Flashcard Collection (Priority: P3)

A language learner wants to organize their flashcards by editing, deleting, or viewing their entire collection to manage their study materials effectively.

**Why this priority**: This provides long-term usability and maintenance of the learning materials, but isn't essential for the core learning experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by editing existing flashcards, deleting unwanted ones, and browsing the collection without affecting the core create/study functionality.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user has flashcards in their collection, **When** they view the collection page, **Then** they see all their flashcards with options to edit or delete
2. **Given** the user selects a flashcard to edit, **When** they modify the content and save, **Then** the flashcard is updated with the new content
3. **Given** the user deletes a flashcard, **When** they confirm the deletion, **Then** the flashcard is permanently removed from their collection

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user tries to start a study session with no flashcards?
- How does the system handle extremely long text on flashcard sides?
- What occurs when a user attempts to create duplicate flashcards?
- How does the system respond to network connectivity issues during flashcard creation or study?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to start a study session with their flashcards
- **FR-005**: System MUST display flashcards one at a time during study sessions
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow users to reveal the back side of a flashcard during study
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow users to mark their response as correct or incorrect
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide a way to view all created flashcards
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow users to edit existing flashcards
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow users to delete flashcards from their collection
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle empty flashcard collections gracefully

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Flashcard**: Represents a learning card with front text (question/word) and back text (answer/translation), creation timestamp, and unique identifier
- **StudySession**: Represents a learning session containing flashcards to review, current position, and user responses
- **UserResponse**: Represents a user's self-assessment (correct/incorrect) for a specific flashcard during study

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*
