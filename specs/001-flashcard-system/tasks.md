# Tasks: Flashcard Learning System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-flashcard-system/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories)

**Tests**: Tests are MANDATORY per project constitution (Testing Standards principle). All user stories MUST include unit, integration, and e2e tests following TDD methodology.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- Paths follow plan.md structure with separate backend and frontend directories

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [ ] T001 Create backend directory structure per implementation plan in backend/
- [ ] T002 Create frontend directory structure per implementation plan in frontend/

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Create Flashcards (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Enable users to create flashcards with front/back text content and save them persistently

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Requires flashcards to exist but is independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Requires flashcards to exist but is independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (mandatory) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services
- Services before API endpoints
- API endpoints before frontend components
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks can run in parallel
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Backend and frontend work within the same story can run in parallel if properly coordinated

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task T015: "Unit test for Flashcard model validation in backend/tests/unit/test_flashcard_model.py"
Task T016: "Unit test for flashcard service create method in backend/tests/unit/test_flashcard_service.py"
Task T017: "Integration test for flashcard creation API in backend/tests/integration/test_flashcard_routes.py"
Task T018: "End-to-end test for flashcard creation flow in frontend/tests/integration/test_flashcard_creation.js"

# After tests are written and failing, implement in dependency order:
# T019 ‚Üí T020 ‚Üí T021 ‚Üí T022 ‚Üí T023 ‚Üí T024 ‚Üí T025
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo basic flashcard creation system

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Complete learning loop)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Full management system)
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Backend focus)
   - Developer B: User Story 1 (Frontend focus)
   - Once US1 complete: Split into US2 and US3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Tests MUST be written first and MUST fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- File-based storage keeps implementation simple per plan requirements
- Focus on simplicity and clarity per constitution principles
