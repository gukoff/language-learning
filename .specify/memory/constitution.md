# Learn-a-Language Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality First
Code MUST prioritize maintainability, readability, and reliability over quick delivery. Every contribution requires:
- Clear, self-documenting code with meaningful variable/function names
- Consistent formatting using project linting rules (enforced pre-commit)
- Code review approval from at least one team member
- Maximum function complexity of 15 cyclomatic complexity points
- Documentation for all public APIs and complex business logic

**Rationale**: Language learning applications require long-term maintenance and feature evolution. Technical debt compromises user experience and development velocity.

### II. Testing Standards (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Comprehensive testing MUST be implemented for all features using a three-tier approach:
- **Unit Tests**: Minimum 85% code coverage for business logic and utilities
- **Integration Tests**: All API endpoints, database interactions, and external service connections
- **End-to-End Tests**: Critical user journeys (lesson completion, progress tracking, user authentication)
- Tests MUST be written before implementation (TDD methodology)
- All tests MUST pass before merge to main branch

**Rationale**: Language learning platforms handle user progress data and educational content that must function reliably. Testing prevents learning disruptions and data loss.

### III. User Experience Consistency
All user interfaces MUST maintain consistent design patterns and interaction behaviors:
- Adherence to established design system and style guide
- Consistent navigation patterns across all screens/pages
- Uniform error messaging and feedback mechanisms
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum)
- Cross-platform consistency for responsive applications
- User flows tested on target devices and screen sizes

**Rationale**: Language learners need predictable, accessible interfaces to focus on learning rather than navigation. Inconsistency creates cognitive load that impedes education.

### IV. Performance Requirements
Application performance MUST meet measurable benchmarks for optimal learning experience:
- **Page Load Time**: < 2 seconds for initial load, < 500ms for subsequent navigations
- **API Response Time**: < 300ms for p95 of all endpoints
- **Memory Usage**: < 100MB peak for mobile applications
- **Offline Capability**: Core learning features available without internet connection
- **Battery Efficiency**: Mobile apps optimized for minimal battery drain
- Performance monitoring and alerts configured for production

**Rationale**: Language learning requires focused attention. Performance issues break concentration and create barriers to consistent practice habits.

## Quality Gates

All features MUST pass these quality gates before release:

### Pre-Development Gates
- Feature specification reviewed and approved
- Performance impact assessment completed
- Accessibility requirements defined
- Test strategy documented

### Development Gates
- Code review completed with approval
- All automated tests passing (unit, integration, e2e)
- Performance benchmarks met in staging environment
- Security scan completed with no critical vulnerabilities
- Accessibility testing completed for new UI components

### Release Gates
- Full regression testing completed
- Performance monitoring confirms production readiness
- Rollback plan documented and tested
- User acceptance testing completed for new features

## Development Workflow

### Code Standards
- Follow established coding style guides for chosen technology stack
- Use static analysis tools integrated into CI/CD pipeline
- Document architectural decisions in ADR (Architecture Decision Record) format
- Regular code refactoring sessions to maintain code health

### Review Process
- All code changes require peer review via pull request
- Reviews must verify: functionality, testing, performance, accessibility
- No direct commits to main branch allowed
- Emergency hotfixes require retrospective review within 24 hours

### Testing Discipline
- Test-driven development (TDD) enforced for all new features
- Flaky tests addressed within one sprint
- Test data management strategy documented and followed
- Regular test suite maintenance and optimization

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines. All team members MUST verify compliance during code reviews and feature planning.

**Amendment Process**: Constitutional changes require unanimous team approval and documented rationale. All dependent templates and documentation MUST be updated within one sprint of amendments.

**Compliance Review**: Monthly retrospectives include constitution compliance assessment. Violations are addressed immediately with process improvements.
